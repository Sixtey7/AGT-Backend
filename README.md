## Annual Goal Tracker - Backend
Backend of an annual goal tracking application written in Python using Flask and SQLAlchemy.  

Allows a user to create and track goals of things they want to accomplish over the course of the year.  

This includes two types of goals:
* An item in which the item is completed in one fell swoop (Pay off a loan)
* Items that need to be tracked over the course of the year (e.g. go to the gym 50 times)
    * These can be both positive and negative (e.g. drink less than 50 cans of soda)
